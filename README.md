# freecodecamp-solution-parser
Easy to use tool to make your downloaded Freecodecamp solution readable

Downloaded Freecodecamp solutions are in JSON format so I decided to create this project so anyone can use it to easily convert the downloaded
solution in JSON format to readable code.

No libraries or frameworks were used. I decided to use plain HTML, CSS, and Javasript just for learning purposes.
