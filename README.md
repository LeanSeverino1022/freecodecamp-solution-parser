# freecodecamp-solution-parser
Easy to use tool to make your downloaded Freecodecamp solution readable

[HERE! PLEASE USE IT](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/LeanSeverino1022/freecodecamp-solution-parser/blob/master/index.html)

Downloaded Freecodecamp solutions are in JSON format so I decided to create this project so anyone can use it to easily convert the downloaded
solution in JSON format to readable code.

No libraries or frameworks were used. I decided to use plain HTML, CSS, and Javasript just for learning purposes.

The design is not that good, if you can give me ideas on how to make it better, that would be great.
