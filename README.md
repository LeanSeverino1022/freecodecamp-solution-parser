Downloaded Freecodecamp solutions are in JSON format so I decided to create this project for my personal use and so anyone can use it too to easily convert the downloaded solution in JSON format to readable code.

No libraries or frameworks were used. I decided to use plain HTML, CSS, and Javasript just for learning purposes.
